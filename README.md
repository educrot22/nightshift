# nightshift

A Python package to compute and visualize observations phase coverage.

In Astronomy, *nighshift* is useful to answer the following questions:
- How much an orbit with period $P$ has been observed given certain observation times?
- How a certain target must be observed to cover all orbits with periods lower than $P$ days?
